# Hey Friendo, it's DW (he/him).

My name is David Wesst, but a lot of people call me DW or Wessty for short. I work as an enterprise solution architect at the University of Manitoba, where I solve IT challenges with a focus on integration modernization for legacy enterprise systems. When I'm not bringing enterprises into the future, I am working on [tech talks][talks-repo], hacking on my [website][website-link], or working on my dream video game project.
