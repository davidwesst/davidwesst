# Hey Friendo, it's DW (he/him).
 My goal is simple: **Play and Build Cool Stuff**. That's it.
 
What is _cool stuff_ to me? Usually video games and web-platform code and tech, but I would hate to limit my interests. üòé 

I am a Solution Architect by daylight and have a little over a decade of software development experience in a variety of technologies, focusing using on web platform (i.e. JavaScript, Node) and C#. By moonlight, I exercise my creative side with code and gameplay, which I share on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9pm (UTC-6) on [Twitch][twitch-link]...but check the [schedule][twitch-schedule] to get the latest.

## Where to Find Me
I've been on social media since it became a thing, but these are the places I'm most active.
