# Hey Friendo, it's DW (he/him).
I try to enable creativity with technology, one game at a time. My goal is to build cool stuff, plain and simple. 

By day, I work in technology by architecting software solutions. By night, I exercise my creativity by creating content, code, and whatever else I feel like making. I ❤️ video games, especially the weird indie ones, and love tinkering in game development.
