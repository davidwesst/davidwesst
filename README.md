# Hey Friendo, it's DW (he/him).
My goal is simple: **code cool stuff**, but I like to think of that as **making ideas a reality through code, creativity, and devops**.

On the tech side usually focus on DevOps Tooling, Web Platform Tech, and .NET with a facination with C. On the softer side, I'm a firm believer in clear and continual communication, which is why I pratice on [Twitch][twitch-link] weekly; and applying creativity to create innovative software solutions.

## Where to Find Me
I've been on social media since it became a thing, but these are the places I'm most active.
