# Hey Friendo, it's DW (he/him).
I try to enable creativity with technology, one game at a time. My goal is to **play and build cool stuff**, plain and simple. 

By day, I work in technology by architecting software solutions. By night, I exercise my creativity by creating content, code, and whatever else I feel like making. Oh, and I ❤️ video games. Especially the weird indie ones and anything _"retro"_. When I'm not playing, I'm tinkering in game development by doing the occasional jam.
