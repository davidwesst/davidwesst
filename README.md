# Hey Friendo, it's DW (he/him).
My name is  David Wesst, but a lot of people call me DW or Wessty for short. I work as an enterprise solution architect at the University of Manitoba, where I solve IT challenges. I also host _Remember the Human_, a podcast that explores how AI impacts people and their stories. I built my technology career on my interest and passion for web standards, JavaScript, and everything web-related. When I am not working or podcasting, I enjoy playing and creating video games, because I am a gamer with a youthful spirit and a nerd with a big heart.
